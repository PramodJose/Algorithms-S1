# Only the first two lines are read by the program.
# The first line contains characters separated by white-spaces. Characters like space and newline can be represented as
# 'sp' and 'nl', respectively. Any other meaningful combination can be used, if required.
# The second line contains integers representing the frequency of the corresponding character on the first line.
# It is assumed that the number of integers on the second line equals the number of characters on the first line.
